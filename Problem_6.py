## 6. Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

In this problem I had to write the union and intersection functions. The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.

I had taken in the the two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection respectively.
