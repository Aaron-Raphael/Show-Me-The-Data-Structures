5. Blockchain

A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created and text strings as the data.

We can breakdown the blockchain down into having 3 main parts.
- First is the information hash
- The next main component is the block on the blockchain
- Finally link all of this together in a block chain
